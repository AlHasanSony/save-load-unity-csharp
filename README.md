# SaveLoadManager for Unity Game Engine

This repository contains C# scripts for the Unity game engine that implement a versatile SaveLoadManager.

Two versions are available:

- One utilizes BinaryFormatter and FileStream for robust data storage.
- The other offers a lightweight storage solution using PlayerPrefs.

These scripts enable you to efficiently save and load game data, simplifying the process of managing and persisting player progress in your Unity projects.

Feel free to explore and integrate these scripts into your Unity games!
