## SaveLoadManager for Unity Game Engine

This repository contains C# scripts for the Unity game engine that implement a SaveLoadManager. Two different versions are available:

1. **SaveLoadBinaryFormatter.cs:** Uses BinaryFormatter and FileStream for saving and loading game data.

2. **SaveLoadPlayerPrefs.cs:** Uses PlayerPrefs for a lightweight storage solution.

These scripts provide options for saving and loading game data, making it easier to manage and persist player progress in your Unity games.

Feel free to explore and use these scripts in your Unity projects!
